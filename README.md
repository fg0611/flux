# Flux Challenge

This application can handle two types of file CSV and TXT each type with specific data content and allows to convert one to another and vice versa. 
The content corresponds to one-day Transaction data and is presented in different formats depending on the type of file.

Also, when a file is uploaded, a Download button appears to save the new file to the device's hard drive.
